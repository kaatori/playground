kaatori / playground README

This repository is a small collection of the first exercises I did while learning Python before I took a properly free online course. 

Some of the exercises are from YouTube tutorials. Some of them are from the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). The W3C (https://www.w3.org/) has a lot of exercises and online courses which I recommend because the W3C is the organization responsible for standardizing the World Wide Web (WWW). This includes educating the public about proper coding practices for the Internet (as we have come to know it) to be as accessible and user-friendly as possible. 

Thank you for reading, and let me know if you have comments!
